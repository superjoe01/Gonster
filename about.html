    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      GONSTER was born from the dream of Kayla, an immigrant who arrived in the United States with nothing but $20 in her pocket and an unshakable vision. With a fire in her heart and a taste for greatness, she set out to redefine what it means to energize the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      After working night shifts and sleeping in her car, Kayla began experimenting with bold blends of traditional Irish stout flavors and high-powered energy drinks. Her garage became her lab, her notebook filled with flavor ratios and sketchy caffeine calculations. It was there she created her first concoction — a gritty, dark, powerful drink that woke people up and made them feel invincible.
    </p>
    <p>
      She called it GONSTER — a fusion of the unstoppable strength of Monster and the timeless legacy of Guinness. With hustle and vision, Kayla turned her idea into a movement. A drink that stands for power, grit, and elegance. Today, GONSTER is more than a beverage — it's a badge of those who fight for their dream no matter the odds.
    </p>
    <p>
      We honor Kayla’s journey with every can. And we honor you — the next bold visionary — with every sip.
